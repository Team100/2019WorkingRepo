# Auton Selector

This is demo code for an autonomous sendable chooser. During my initial testing, the data seemed to get over reliably, _though I need to do more testing_.

## Important Files

- `Robot.java` creates the sendable chooser and holds the `Autonomous_Init` function which processes the sendable chooser

- `Auton1.java`, `Auton2.java`, `ExampleCommand.java` process the data
